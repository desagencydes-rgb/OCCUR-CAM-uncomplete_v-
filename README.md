## OCCUR-CAM ‚Äî Project Documentation

This repository contains a face-recognition and multi-camera monitoring system. The codebase mixes a Python backend API, multiple recognizer implementations, camera managers, and demos. All rights are reserved.

This README is intentionally comprehensive and points to deeper documentation in the `docs/` folder. It contains an installation quickstart, high-level architecture, risks and mitigations, and pointers to tests and modelization diagrams.

High-level contents
- Overview and purpose
- Quick installation (Windows + Linux)
- Requirements (software, hardware, build tools)
- Running demos and services
- Troubleshooting and known issues
- Links to detailed docs (architecture, API, tests, risks)

Important note: This README and the docs directory are documentation-only artifacts. No source code was modified.

Quickstart (Windows PowerShell)

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (Python 3.8+ recommended):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install build tools and dependencies (see `docs/INSTALLATION.md` for full guidance). On Windows you'll usually need Visual C++ Build Tools (see docs), and optionally CUDA/toolkit for GPU builds.

3. Install Python dependencies (choose CPU or GPU set as appropriate):

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or for more complete dev/runtime requirements
pip install -r requirements-full.txt
```

4. Configure `config/camera_config.yaml` and `config/settings.py` for your environment. The repository includes example camera configuration in `config/camera_config.yaml`.

5. Run a demo locally:

```powershell
python examples/standalone_demo.py
```

Where to read more
- Architecture and component diagrams: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Full installation instructions: `docs/INSTALLATION.md`
- API and codebase overview: `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Tests, modelization and test artifacts: `docs/TESTS_AND_MODELS.md`
- Risks, mitigations and recommendations: `docs/RISKS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`

Policies and safety

This project performs face detection and recognition. Before deploying, ensure you understand local laws and privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). The docs contain a dedicated section covering data retention, consent, bias and model performance considerations.

Developer context and empathy

During audit we observed many pragmatic choices in the codebase that are typical for time-pressed, first-time efforts (see `docs/RISKS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`). The goal of this documentation is to explain the current shape, defend the developer's choices with context, and provide prioritized, practical remediation steps.

How you can help
- If you want the repository to contain automated diagrams or packaged docs (Sphinx, mkdocs), I can add a docs scaffold and scripts. This initial pass intentionally avoids code changes.

   # Check camera availability
   python -c "import cv2; cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0); print(cap.isOpened())"
   ```

2. **Face Recognition Not Working**
   ```bash
   # Check InsightFace installation
   python -c "import insightface; print('InsightFace OK')"
   ```

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce camera resolution in config
   - Lower FPS setting
   - Check CPU usage and memory

4. **Database Errors**
   ```bash
   # Recreate database
   python scripts/setup.py --force
   ```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```bash
python main.py --debug
```

Check logs in `logs/occur_cam.log` for detailed information.
